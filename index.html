      <p>Preamble

        This activity was designed to help couples understand their roles, responsibilities and duties in marriage according to God's standard.
        
        It is expected that Christian couples in this group( as members of the body of Christ - the church) will exemplify God's model for marriage.
        
        In this day and age where the world is struggling with what is true and what is false, the church has to live up to our responsibility as the pillar and ground of the truth (1 Tim 3:15)
        
        We can not rely on the world or our experiences to define truth. The word of God is truth (John 17:17). 
        If the foundation is destroyed what can the righteous do?
        
        It is our prayers that the truth of the Word of God will and cause us by His spirit to be responsible married children of God
        
        
        
        Scripture Reference
        1 Timothy  3:15  But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.
        
        John  17:17  Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.</p>
